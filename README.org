Julia wrapper for the [[http://fy.chalmers.se/subatom/wigxjpf/][WIGXJPF]] library used to calculate Wigner 3j, 6j
and 9j symbols. Since the original library is release under the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GPLv3]]
license, so is this Julia wrapper.

* Example usage
  The original library expects all arguments to multiplied by two. For
  instance, to calculate the 3j symbol (1 1 0; 0 0 0) = -1/âˆš3, one
  would say
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :session *julia*
    using WIGXJPF

    wig3jj(2, 2, 0,
           0, 0, 0)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : -0.5773502691896258

  This Julia library also provides a wrapper which performs the
  multiplication by two under the hood:
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :session *julia*
    wig3j(1, 1, 0,
          0, 0, 0)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : -0.5773502691896258

  It also works for rational arguments:
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :session *julia*
    wig3j(1//2,  1//2, 0,
          1//2, -1//2, 0)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0.7071067811865475
